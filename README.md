# Unofficial FIIT STU template for final theses in Typst

**This template is WIP (Work in Progress), contains a lot of things to be fixed and should be used with caution**

If you want to help with perfecting this template, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.

## About
This is an **unofficial** FIIT STU thesis template for writing in Typst. It is based on the official FIIT STU thesis guidelines and the unofficial FIIT STU LaTeX template.

It was created to make writing theses easier with `Typst` rather than `LaTeX` and more accessible to students of the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava.

## Installation
<!-- How to install, setup, need of typst installed localy cuz we use @preview imports -->
If you want to use this template, because it is WIP (Work in Progress) you need to clone this repository and then you can start modying the [main.typ](main.typ) file.

Later on, when the template is more stable, it will be available in the Typst Universe and you will be able to use it directly from there by importing it as a package.

If you do not have or do not want to use Typst locally, you can use the [Typst Web Editor](https://typst.app/). You need to download the `lib.typ` and `main.typ` files and then upload them. You will probably need to change the import statements in the `main.typ` file to point to the correct location of the `lib.typ` file.
