- [ ] make page numbering position parameter to choose the numbering to be like in a book (on specific side when page is even/odd) or in the middle for just digital version
- [ ] fix numbering of appendices (first fix appendices in general !!)
- [ ] numbering for appendices is OKAY in ToC, however in the document itself it shows number instead of letter for heading 1, also the page numbering for appendices is broken
- [x] assignment image, dont know if it must be .png .jpg or that typst can input .pdf (test the .pdf input method as it was added in new compiler version 0.13.x i think)
- [x] maybe make honest declaration as user input because of `vypracoval(a)` is gender dependent (NOTE: the slovak version with `vypracoval(a)` is okay and this was not needed to be changed)
- [x] make 1st level headings to be bold/strong in Table of Contents but not in List of figures, and list of tables
- [x] fix bibliography to show in Table of Contents without numbering (it should actually be there as the guidelines say)
- [x] fix 2nd and deeper level headings to not show or show properly in Table of Contents for appendices
- [ ] fix the counter to now show numbering on blank pages before ToC (Table of Contents) and Introduction (on blank pages in general)
